# Cicosearch

A prototype React app for searching an index of Cicognara records, using Fuse.js.

## What's It For?
To explore the use of Fuse.js to meet client requirement for a search bar like the one in the 
old site.

It uses an index that is compiled from the Getty records using the
`compile_records.rb` script in cicognara-static/bin.

This prototype uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) as a framework for running the app; this is just
for testing and evaluation and does not imply any commitment to Vite or React.

## How do I run it?

``npm run dev``

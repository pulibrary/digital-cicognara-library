            <li xmlns="">Emblems of mortality : representing, in upwards of fifty cuts, Death seizing all ranks
               and degrees of people : imitated from a painting in the cemetery of the Dominican
               church at Basil, in Switzerland : with an apostrophe to each, translated from the
               Latin and French, intended as well for the information of the curious, as the instruction
               and entertainment of youth : to which is prefixed a copious preface, containing an
               historical account of the above, and other paintings on this subject, now or lately
               existing in divers parts of Europe.</li>

On Friday July 27th 2018 Jonathan Franklin (The National Gallery, London) is giving a talk on "<a href="https://arlislondon.wixsite.com/arlislondon2018/franklin">Museum libraries and library history: joining the research conversation at the National Gallery</a>".  He will present the "founding library" of the National Gallery in London acquired in 1870 from the widow of its first Director, Sir Charles Eastlake (1793-1865), and touch amongst others on the library of Sir Eastlake's contemporary, Count Leopoldo Cicognara (1767-1834).

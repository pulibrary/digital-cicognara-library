<h1>Become a Contributing Partner</h1>
<p>Contributions to the Digital Cicognara Library project are made through the
  <a href="http://portal.getty.edu/">Getty Research Portal</a>. This workflow allows the project
  to complement related Portal resources by presenting volumes from the Cicognara Library within
  the larger art historical context. The digital facsimiles are displayed via
  <a href="https://iiif.io/">International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)</a> on the
  Digital Cicognara Library website.</p>
<p>To become a contributing partner, an institution must submit at least one digital surrogate
  to the Getty Research Portal within one year of the initial committment.</p>

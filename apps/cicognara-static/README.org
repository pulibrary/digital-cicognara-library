#+title: Digital Cicognara Library 2.0
A Jekyll-based static site to replace [[https://github.com/pulibrary/cicognara-rails][Cicognara Rails]]. *Note:* Jekyll's ~/_site/~ directory is checked in, so changes are pre-rendered and Jekyll is not needed, unless you need to update or reformat (however, see Update below.)

* Background
Since 2015 or so, the Princeton University Library has collaborated with a consortium of libraries and research institutions, with funding from the Kress Foundation, on a project called the [[https://cicognara.org/][Digital Cicognara Library]].  Labeled "an open-access collection of the early literature of the arts," this project combines two distinct efforts: (1) to create a union catalog of copies and similar editions of some 5,000 imprints collected by Count Leopoldo Cicognara (1767–1834) and itemized in his /Catalogo ragionato dei libri d’arte e d’antichità/; (2) to build a web resource that enables users to read and compare digital facsimiles of these titles.

Cicognara's original library now resides in the Vatican; in the 1980s, the Kress Foundation sponsored a project to create a microfiche edition of the entire library (more than one million pages).  Many of the original imprints have since been deemed too fragile to be handled, so a similar edition of digital images cannot be made; instead, in 2016 or so, the Kress Foundation digitized its microfiche edition while acknowledging that digitized microfiche does not provide the reading experience many users expect today.

In lieu of digitizing Cicognara's holdings anew, several research institutions began to examine their holdings for copies, or similar editions, of Cicognara's volumes that could be presented to the reading public as substitutes: the collaborating institutions digitize what they find and make their digital editions available, via the Web, in a digital re-creation of Cicognara's library.

All the partner institutions send their metadata (MARC records and IIIF manifests) to the Getty Research Center, which disseminates them as part of the [[https://portal.getty.edu/][Getty Research Portal]].  The presentation of these digital editions as a virtual Cicognara library has been the responsibility of PUL, which has built and maintains a system of bespoke software to harvest bibliographic records and IIIF manifests from the Getty, process and index them, and display them in a web browser.  The software provides some search capabilities, along with a way to browse the collection through a TEI-encoded edition of Cicognara's /Catalogo/.

That software is showing its age, and PUL can no longer support bespoke digital library applications like it.  Furthermore, the aims and rationales for the system have changed over the years, as have the relationships among and commitments of the institutional partners.  In 2021, the Kress Foundation provided PUL with an eighteen-month grant to sunset the current Cicognara application and migrate as much of its functionality as possible to other, sustainable platforms.

* The Digital Cicognara Library, version 1
The name, /Digital Cicognara Library/, is misleading; it implies that the subject so named is a virtual collection, or a virtual space, that replicates or simulates Count Cicognara's original library.  While this is partially true, the Digital Cicognara Library is actually an organization: a consortium of research institutions engaged in several distinct, though related, activities:

1. *Compiling a Union Catalog.* The discovery, comparison, and description of these copies constitutes a significant bibliographic research project in its own right.  This was the earliest activity of the consortium, and it is the work of trained bibliographers, not technologists.  It is painstaking, scholarly work, largely unfunded.  These endeavors have yielded a few surprises, including the complex bibliographic nature of some of Cicognara's holdings.  Before the project began, it was assumed that most, if not all, of Cicognara's volumes were, while old, not particularly rare, and that duplicates or similar editions could be found in the partners' holdings.  Close examination of the /Catalogo/ revealed that some of Cicognara's volumes were idiosyncratic /Sammelbände/ for which no duplicates existed.  The complexities of early modern publishing also made it difficult to impossible to determine how closely an edition held by a partner institution corresponded with Cicognara's copy.

2. *Creating Digital Editions.* At the outset, the partner institutions were made responsible for digitizing their own holdings: for creating and curating high-quality digital images; for writing IIIF manifests that could be used to display the digital editions with any capable IIIF viewer; and for maintaining a IIIF image server for delivering the images.  In practice, a number of the partners have been unable to fulfill one or more of these responsibilities.

3. *Providing a Digital Reading Interface.* PUL has been responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the software that drives the DCL web site.  That software, [[https://github.com/pulibrary/cicognara-rails][cicognara-rails]], is a web application, written using the Ruby on Rails framework, that bundles a number of distinct functionalities:

   - /it harvests the CDL's metadata from the Getty Portal./ This metadata includes MARC records and IIIF manifests from all the partners, which must be filtered, modified, and matched with the app's internal data structures.

   - /it indexes the metadata for search, discovery, and cross-linking./  The cicognara-rails app has no database; all of its data-related functionality relies on separate Solr application, whose deployment must be carefully maintained and whose complex configurations must be updated whenever new functionality is added.

   - /it serves web pages./ The user-visible aspect of the CDL is the Rails application itself.  It has a RESTful API with two endpoints: [[https://cicognara.org/catalog][https://cicognara.org/catalog]], a standard digital-library catalog interface with searching and faceting; and [[https://cicognara.org/catalogo][https://cicognara.org/catalogo]], an HTML rendition of the TEI-encoded /Catalogo/ with links to catalog entries.  The URLs for entries (e.g., [[https://cicognara.org/catalog/1122][https://cicognara.org/catalog/1122]]) resolve to pages that include a list of items matching the catalog item (the digitized microfiche; one or more digitized editions of copies from partner institutions) and a Javascript viewer widget (the [[https://universalviewer.io/][UniversalViewer]]) that renders the IIIF manifest.

* The Digital Cicognara Library, version 2
At the highest level, the /desideratum/ is to retire the current cicognaro-rails app so that PUL's development team is no longer responsible for maintaining a rickety, out-of-date Rails application.  Beyond this organizational imperative, however, PUL's obligations are unclear.  At the very least, the Kress Foundation has asked that the digitization of its microfiche collection be made available, and it is to address this requirement that this small project is proposed.

As outlined above, the Digital Cicognara Library is actually three projects:

1. Providing a digital facsimile of Cicognara's library, linked to the /Catalogo/;
2. Creating a union catalog of duplicates or near editions of the items in Cicognara's library;
3. Digitizing those duplicates and disseminating them as substitutes for the digitized microfiche edition of Cicognara's originals.

Accordingly, version 2 splits the Digital Cicognara Library project into three distinct aspects:

1. A bibliographic project to create a union catalog of editions that correspond with Cicognara's collection;
2. A web resource that exposes that union catalog, along with high-resolution digital editions whenever possible.
3. A web resource that presents Cicognara's library as an historical artifact on its own, via Cicognara's own /Catalogo/ and digital images of his original volumes (albeit secondary images of earlier microfiche capture);

The first aspect is an ongoing research project among the consortium members; the second is served by the Getty Research Portal.  The third is the concern of this repository.

** Architecture: a Static Site
The new Digital Cicognara Library web site is a /static site/: there is no database, and little in the way of dynamic Javascript.  Such static sites are part of a growing trend in web development to reduce complexity, reduce the cost of software maintenance, and limit the site's exposure to cyber attacks.

The site is built using [[https://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]], a static-site generator written in Ruby.  The /Catalogo/ portion of the site is compiled from two sources: the TEI-encoded edition of Cicognara's /Catalogo/ (maintained in a [[https://github.com/pulibrary/cicognara-catalogo][separate GitHub repository]]) and bibliographic records harvested from the Getty Research Portal and processed into TEI files. Shell scripts, Ruby scripts, and XSLT transforms generate a single HTML document containing the text of the /Catalogo/ (making it easily searchable in a browser) and viewer pages that use Mirador to display the various versions of each /Catalogo/ entry.

** Update, 2023
The Jekyll-generated static site (Version 2, or "Cicognara-static") was developed in 2022-2023.  During review, several new requirements emerged:

1. The site must have a search facility like that in Version 1.  Meeting this requirement has required the development of a tool that indexes the Getty records and the deployment of a Javascript-based search tool (Fuse.js); it also requires the entire UI to be re-designed to provide a Blacklight-like interface to the data in the Getty records.
   
2. PUL must compensate for the sporadic nature of updates to the Getty Portal and the uneven nature of the partner records by developing tools and workflows to update the "static site" on demand.
